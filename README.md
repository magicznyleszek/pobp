# POBP

An idea for visual differentiating completely separate parts of a website by using the same pallete of colors to build a theme for each.

## Development

To serve local version of the site:

```
npm run jekyll:serve
```

To build site on disk:

```
npm run jekyll:build
```

To watch assets:

```
npm run watch
```
